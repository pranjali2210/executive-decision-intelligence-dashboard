## Overview  

In fast-moving business environments, leaders struggle with scattered data and slow reporting.  
The **Executive Decision Intelligence Dashboard** solves this by providing a **single source of truth** for performance monitoring and root-cause analysis.

It highlights:
- What is happening (KPIs)
- How performance is trending (monthly revenue line chart)
- Why it is happening (regional breakdown)
- Where opportunities lie (top products)

This enables executives to take **action**, not just view data.
